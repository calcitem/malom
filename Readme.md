You can read about the theory behind the program in our paper linked from our webpage.

The program works on 64-bit Windows.

This repository contains a slightly newer, unreleased version of the code. The v1.1.0 version is the released version downloadable from our website.
The current, v1.1.2 version is a Visual Studio 2017 solution. If you have a newer Visual Studio, then we recommend upgrading the solution and the projects when opening the solution. 
The v1.1.0 is a Visual Studio 2013 solution. (Note, that different dlls are required for these different versions. These should come with your Visual Studio installation.)
