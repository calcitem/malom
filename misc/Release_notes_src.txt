*** Release Notes for Malom 1.1.0 ***
/2018. March 29./

- The major new feature is the position setup mode: You can set up an arbitrary position directly (without playing to it from the starting position). This is useful if you would like to analyze a specific position. (Game menu -> Set Up Position)

- By default, the computer player is now set to “Combined” instead of “Perfect”, where the heuristic AI and the database-based AI work together. (This is better than just the database-based AI alone, in that it is harder to achieve a draw against it.) (Note: the heuristic AI is available only for the standard game variant.)

- Automatically fall back to the heuristic AI when the database is not found at program startup.

- The Advisor now shows the optimal moves better, by drawing a yellow line for sliding and jumping moves. In the old version, the Advisor highlighted only the target squares, but now you can also see which stones to move.

- The Advisor now highlights optimal stone-taking moves as well.

- Improved some texts on the GUI.

- The program no longer exits when answering “no” to the message box at the end of a game.


Minor improvements:

- “Combined” player moves immediately when there is only one optimal move.

- Show perfect evaluation in stone taking positions as well.

- Added option for whether to show the number of moves since the last irreversible move (related to the automatic draw in 50 irreversible moves rule) in the status bar.

- Made the hard limit of thinking time a factor of the soft limit in the heuristic AI. (In the old version the hard limit was hardcoded to 8 seconds, now it is 10*soft+0.2 seconds.)

- Better error handling.

- Minor adjustments to the board drawing.

- Fixed some minor bugs.
